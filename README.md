# About
I am a Teaching Faculty  in the Department of Mathematics  at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My research areas include finite fields and statistics, of which I am interested in both pure and applied sides. During my PhD dissertation, I have studied the quadratic forms over finite fields of characteristic two and I have determined possible pairs of invariants of some quadratic forms. I have used the quadratic trace forms to construct a new set of maximal Artin-Schreier
curves. In the last couple of years, I have also been working on Bayesian Regression Models, Claim Analysis in Insurance, Missing Data Analysis and
Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Models. My recent and ongoing projects include:

1. Using cyclotomic cosets to produce a new set of BCH codes.
2. Working on families of quaternary or in general $p$-ary sequences.
3. Enhancing motor insurance claim prediction sensitivity by applying various machine learning techniques combined with different feature selection and sampling strategies, leading to improved decision-making processes for Insurtech.
4. Predicting the frequency of  traffic crashs by adopting a conditional autoregressive model (CAR) within the Bayesian framework, leading to more accurate forecasts for Pennsylvania counties.
5. Predicting US stock prices using LSTM.
